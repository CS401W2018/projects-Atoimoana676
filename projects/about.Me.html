    <h1>About Andrew</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Mangere, Auckland, New Zealand, but I grew up in Tonga for most of my life. Living in Tonga was an incredible experience because it was a safe and vibrant place. I enjoyed participating in many fun activities such as swimming, camping, archery, cultural events, and band classes, all within a loving and supportive community.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, I had the opportunity to serve in the Tonga Nuku'alofa mission, followed by the New Zealand Hamilton mission. This experience was exciting and taught me the importance of different cultures, which is something that is important to me. I would say this is one experience in my life that had prepared me for other things in life.</p>
