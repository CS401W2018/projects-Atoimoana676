        <h3>2.Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h3>
        <p>absolute link is the url link that is https and leads you to a specific webpage, while a relative link is a link that is in the same folder/domain that has a shorter name like page.html. I would use relative links when I wanna move my website into a new doamin, relative links will still work, whereas absolute links would need to be updated and its shorter and easy to maintain.</p>
