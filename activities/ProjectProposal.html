    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>1.The title and topic of your site.</h2>
    <p>Title: HTH Suppliers, Topic: Supplier businesses</p>
    <h2>2.A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h2>
    <p>I chose this topic because I am interested in learning how to create websites for businesses in Tonga. There aren’t many businesses here that offer website development services, so I see an opportunity to help. My idea started when my uncle asked if I was learning how to make websites and suggested that I try making one for him. That conversation inspired me to start building his website, and now I want to explore this skill further.</p>

    <h2>5. How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h2>
    <p>I will ask owner for the information needed as well as pictures for the pages. Online Research, I will look at similar supplier websites for inspiration, Tongan Business Directories – I will check local business listings for market insights. <strong>My two references are HTH Suppliers Business Documents & Interviews as well as Tonga Chamber of Commerce Website.</strong></p>
