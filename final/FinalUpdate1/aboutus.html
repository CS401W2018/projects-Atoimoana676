        <h1>About HTH Suppliers</h1>
        <h2 class="aboutus1">Business History:</h2>
        <p class="aboutus2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTH Suppliers was founded in 2014 by Haikeni Helu—better known as Keni—who had a vision to build something of his own, grounded in service, reliability, and community. Before starting HTH Suppliers, Keni worked as the manager at Graig Joinery Tonga, where he gained valuable experience and built strong relationships with suppliers and clients. It was during this time that the idea for HTH Suppliers began to take shape. With humble beginnings, Keni started the business by selling solar lights and cleaning supplies, using the supplier connections he had formed during his time in joinery. The sales were small at first, done through friends and word of mouth, but the commitment and passion behind each transaction laid a strong foundation.
        Keni’s journey into entrepreneurship was not without challenges. He didn’t come from a background filled with advantages or formal qualifications—he didn’t finish school, but he did have a strong desire to prove that success is still possible with dedication, resilience, and a willingness to learn. With the support of his family, he worked tirelessly, handling every part of the business himself until it could afford to bring on staff. His goal was not just to build a business, but to create a life of purpose and to show others that it's never too late to chase your dreams and achieve something great.
        Through persistence and a heart for service, HTH Suppliers grew beyond its early offerings. As the business expanded, Keni was able to take a major step forward by purchasing the very company where he once worked—Graig Joinery Tonga. This was not just a business move, but a full-circle moment that symbolized how far HTH had come. Today, HTH Suppliers is a proudly Tongan-owned business offering a diverse range of products and services, including cleaning supplies, solar lighting, self-care products, beverages, furniture, beds, and even custom joinery and construction work.
        From its modest beginnings to becoming a trusted supplier and builder in the community, HTH Suppliers stands as a testament to what can be achieved with faith, family, and hard work. Our journey is deeply rooted in service, and we remain committed to helping others while growing alongside the people and communities we serve.</p>
