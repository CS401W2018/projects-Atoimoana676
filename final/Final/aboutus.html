        <h1>About HTH Suppliers</h1>
        <h2 class="aboutus1">Business History:</h2>
        <p class="aboutus2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTH Suppliers was founded in 2014 by Haikeni Helu—better known as Keni—who had a vision to build something of his own, grounded in service, reliability, and community. Before starting HTH Suppliers, Keni worked as the manager at Graig Joinery Tonga, where he gained valuable experience and built strong relationships with suppliers and clients. It was during this time that the idea for HTH Suppliers began to take shape. With humble beginnings, Keni started the business by selling solar lights and cleaning supplies, using the supplier connections he had formed during his time in joinery. The sales were small at first, done through friends and word of mouth, but the commitment and passion behind each transaction laid a strong foundation.
        Keni’s journey into entrepreneurship was not without challenges. He didn’t come from a background filled with advantages or formal qualifications—he didn’t finish school, but he did have a strong desire to prove that success is still possible with dedication, resilience, and a willingness to learn. With the support of his family, he worked tirelessly, handling every part of the business himself until it could afford to bring on staff. His goal was not just to build a business, but to create a life of purpose and to show others that it's never too late to chase your dreams and achieve something great.
        Through persistence and a heart for service, HTH Suppliers grew beyond its early offerings. As the business expanded, Keni was able to take a major step forward by purchasing the very company where he once worked—Graig Joinery Tonga. This was not just a business move, but a full-circle moment that symbolized how far HTH had come. Today, HTH Suppliers is a proudly Tongan-owned business offering a diverse range of products and services, including cleaning supplies, solar lighting, self-care products, beverages, furniture, beds, and even custom joinery and construction work.
        From its modest beginnings to becoming a trusted supplier and builder in the community, HTH Suppliers stands as a testament to what can be achieved with faith, family, and hard work. Our journey is deeply rooted in service, and we remain committed to helping others while growing alongside the people and communities we serve.</p>

            <h2>How to Make a Website for a Small Business</h2>
        
            <p>For my research project I wanted to make a website for small busnesses to help them improve their services as I know many would like to use the web to expand their ability to serve their customers better but may lack the ability to incorporate web services into their busnesses because of the lack of expertise to do so. Being inspired by a family busness in Tonga going through this issue, I have made a research into how I can accomplish this task. To make a website for a small business, the first thing to do is plan carefully. Every website is different, so there is no one right way to build it, but good planning will help things go faster and with fewer mistakes. <strong> Here are some few steps we can take to build a website for them:</strong></p>
        
            <h3>Step 1: Choose the Purpose of Your Website</h3>
            <p>Think about how your website will help you connect with customers. Do you just need a simple page with information, or do you want to sell products online? This choice will affect your budget, your design, and whether you hire someone or do it yourself.</p>
        
            <h3>Step 2: Make a List of Domain Names</h3>
            <p>Start writing down 10–15 name ideas for your website early. Many people wait too long and then rush when their favorite name is already taken. A good domain name should be short, easy to spell and remember, and show what your business does. Don’t check if the names are available yet—just focus on brainstorming. Also, think about what ending (like .com, .org, or .store) fits your business.</p>
        
            <h3>Step 3: Plan Your Website Pages and Features</h3>
            <p>Even if you want a one-page website, plan what sections you’ll need. Most small business websites include these 5 main pages:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home</strong> – the first page visitors see.</li>
                <li><strong>About Us</strong> – tells your business story.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Us</strong> – shows your location, phone, email, and social media.</li>
                <li><strong>Products or Services</strong> – explains what you sell or offer.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Notices</strong> – for things like privacy policies and rules, which are required by law.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>You can have these as separate pages or all in one long scrolling page. Planning them ahead helps make a better website.</p>
