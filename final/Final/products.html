                    <td>Modern shampoos are more than just cleansers they are carefully formulated with ingredients that clean, condition, and treat both hair and scalp. They contain a mix of surfactants (for cleansing), conditioning agents (for shine and manageability), and active ingredients to help with issues like dandruff. Many shampoos also include moisturizers, fragrances, and preservatives to improve feel, scent, and shelf life. With options tailored to different hair types and scalp needs, shampoos today combine cosmetic and therapeutic benefits for healthier hair and scalp.<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1610-0387.2007.06304.x" class="learn-more"><br>Learn more</a></td>

                    <td>Solar cells are connected to a rechargeable AA NiCad battery through a diode, which stops power from flowing back at night. The battery charges during the day, unless it's cloudy or winter. At night, when the solar cells stop working, a photoresistor senses the darkness and turns on the LED using a circuit with transistors. The controller board manages power from the solar cell and battery and uses a three-transistor setup to control the light. A full battery can run the LED for around 18 hours and more depending on the solar you buy. Solar cells and batteries cost a lot to make. Solar cells are made from silicon in clean labs, which adds to the price.<a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/solar-light.htm" class="learn-more">Learn more</a></td>

                    <td>Vinyl flooring has many advantages. It's soft, quiet, water-resistant, easy to install, low-cost, and comes in many styles and colors. It's also eco-friendly uses recycled materials. However, vinyl can be hard to remove if glued down, may dent or get punctured by heavy or sharp objects, and can fade with too much sunlight. Because of this, it's not ideal for sunny areas. But newer vinyl products are stronger and more resistant to heat, water, and fading, making them better for busy homes and sunny spaces.<a href="https://home.tarkett.com/en_EU/node/what-is-vinyl-flooring-and-how-is-it-made-8511" class="learn-more">Learn more</a></td>

                    <td>When testing a mattress, spend at least 10 minutes lying on it to get a real feel. While on your back, your spine should stay neutral—not arched—and your hips and shoulders should feel supported. On your side, your neck should align with your spine, and your shoulders and hips should be cushioned. Although sleeping on your stomach isn’t recommended, if you do, make sure your back feels flat and your midsection is cradled. Check the edge support by sitting and lying near the edge to see if it feels stable and secure. If you share the bed, test for motion isolation to see if one person’s movements disturb the other. All these steps will help you choose a mattress that offers comfort and proper support.<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/mattresses/buying-guide/" class="learn-more">Learn more</a></td>

                    <td>Occasionally drinking energy drinks is generally safe for healthy adults, but regular use can be harmful. The caffeine and other ingredients may increase heart rate, blood pressure, and cause sleep issues. High sugar content can also lead to weight gain, and consuming too many energy drinks at once can result in caffeine toxicity. It is possible to overdose on energy drinks due to their high caffeine content. While soda and coffee have much less caffeine, some energy drinks contain 150–300 mg per serving. Since 400 mg is the FDA’s recommended daily limit for adults, drinking just two energy drinks at once can approach or exceed that amount.<a href="https://www.poison.org/articles/energy-drinks?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnui_BhDlARIsAEo9Guvry2UC6YQOafltlmV8efAVwOpAQWl75ejVAv5SG6ft1uT1A_vJwRUaAosyEALw_wcB" class="learn-more">Learn more</a></td>
